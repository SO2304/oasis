# Mesh v0B on silicon — Phase 3 (2026-10-06)

Firmware git stamp in **every** log line below: **`d285ef4`**, built from a
committed tree. Same three RP2040 clone boards (A/B/C), wired UART chain
A.GP0→B.GP1, B.GP0→C.GP1 + common GND, 115 200 baud. Spec:
`docs/MESH_V0B_SPEC.md`. **Every number here comes from a raw log in this
folder**; hashes in `SHA256SUMS`.

v0B binds the payload (via `SHA-256`), the monotonic counter and the
`network_id` into the Ed25519-signed data, enforces revocation/network at the
relay, and verifies **before** mutating any state.

### 1. Relay

```
OASIS|B|UART|ARRIVED|msg_id=10830354352046574055,hops=0,sig=verified,forward=true
OASIS|C|UART|ARRIVED|msg_id=10830354352046574055,hops=1,sig=verified,forward=true
```

### 2. Bit-flip sweep — the headline

One bit is flipped at a uniformly random position **before** framing, so the
CRC8 is valid over the corrupted bytes and the packet reaches B's Ed25519
verifier (the same method as the 2026-10-04 v0A "Phase 4").

| run | accepted | dropped |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | **0** | 49 |
| 2 | **0** | 49 |
| 3 | **0** | 49 |

**0 of 150** corrupted packets were accepted, against **12 of 50 accepted under
v0A**, because v0A signed only `magic‖msg_id‖origin_fp` and left the payload
unauthenticated. Drop reasons seen across runs: `bad mesh signature` (the bulk),
`foreign network`, `unknown sender`, `ttl/hops out of range`, `bad mesh magic`,
`length mismatch` — i.e. the flip is caught by whichever check owns that byte.

*(49 rather than 50 per run is the capture window closing on the last in-flight
packet; the invariant being measured — accepted = 0 — is unaffected.)*

**Honest note on ttl/hops.** An earlier run of the same sweep (before a
provenance fix, logs not retained) showed 1/50 accepted, and its log line read
`sig=verified`. That is the designed behaviour, not a bypass: `ttl` and `hops`
must mutate at each hop, so they are deliberately **not** signed — they are only
range-checked. A flip landing there leaves an authentic payload/origin/counter
and is accepted with a valid signature. **No content, origin, counter or network
forgery was ever accepted.**

### 3. Content-swap / message suppression

A sends a copy whose 14-byte payload is swapped (`REAL`→`FAKE`) with the
**original signature kept**, then the real message:

```
OASIS|B|UART|DROP|bad mesh signature            <- forged copy
OASIS|B|UART|ARRIVED|msg_id=14412014626722181781,hops=0,sig=verified,forward=true
OASIS|B|UART|RELAYED|msg_id=14412014626722181781,hops=0
OASIS|C|UART|ARRIVED|msg_id=14412014626722181781,hops=1,sig=verified,forward=true
```

Under v0A this attack *succeeded*: the forged content kept a valid signature
(payload unsigned) and was remembered, so the genuine message — same `msg_id` —
was then discarded as a duplicate. Under v0B the forgery fails the signature
**before** any state is touched, so the real message still arrives.

### 4. T8 — reboot-replay across a real power-cut

Sequence (A = origin, B = relay; B's USB physically unplugged and replugged):

| step | event | log |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A originates v0B `counter=165` | `V0B_T8_TX\|counter=165,len=111` |
| 2 | B accepts it **when fresh** | `ARRIVED\|...,sig=verified` |
| 3 | B flushes its window to flash | `PERSIST_SAVED\|ok=true,bytes=40,a_last_seen=165` |
| 4 | **physical USB power-cut of B** (RAM wiped) | — |
| 5 | B back up; window read back | `PERSIST_SAVED\|ok=true,bytes=40,a_last_seen=165` |
| 6 | A sends an old counter (`3`) | `V0B_T8_TX\|counter=3,len=111` |
| 7 | B rejects it | `DROP\|stale counter` |

Step 5 is the proof of persistence: B's RAM was erased by the power-cut, so the
only possible source of `a_last_seen=165` is the flash sector. Step 7 is the
proof it is *enforced*. The negative control is step 2 — B accepted that very
counter while it was fresh — and the PC-side control
(`v0b_replay_after_reboot_rejected`) shows a relay **without** persistence
accepting the same replay.

Implementation: the `CounterTracker` serialization (`CTR\x03`, 40 bytes for one
sender) is written to the last 4 KiB flash sector through `rp2040-flash`'s
RAM-safe bootrom helpers, and restored on boot **before** any v0B envelope is
processed.

### 5. On-chip cost (K=5 medians, RP2040 Cortex-M0+, no FPU)

| op | v0A | v0B | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sign (cached keypair) | 173 747 µs (≈173.7 ms) | 175 513 µs (≈175.5 ms) | **+1.0 %** |
| verify | 177 925 µs (≈177.9 ms) | 179 086 µs (≈179.1 ms) | **+0.7 %** |

Raw line: `V0B_TIMING|v0a_sign_us=173747,v0b_sign_us=175513,v0a_verify_us=177925,v0b_verify_us=179086`.
Ed25519 dominates and is payload-size
independent; v0B's extra cost is one SHA-256 of the payload. Matches the PC
bench (`evidence/mesh_v0b/2026-10-06/`), which also measured ≈ +1 %.

## Finding: the sender also needs counter persistence (liveness gap)

T8 exposed a real gap that is **not** a security flaw but a **liveness** one.
During the power-cut, board **A** was also reset (its `tx_counter` restarted at
1, visible in step 6). B had correctly persisted `a_last_seen=165`, so **every**
counter A could now produce (1, 2, 3 …) was `≤ 165` and was refused as
`stale counter`. A rebooted sender is therefore locked out of a relay that
remembers it, until its counter climbs past the remembered high-water mark.

This is exactly the sender-side **counter lease** the spec flags as a decision
point (`docs/MESH_V0B_SPEC.md` §5): the origin must persist a counter *ceiling*
ahead of use (e.g. blocks of 256) and resume **from the ceiling** after a
reboot, so it never reuses a counter and always resumes above anything it
previously sent. Receiver-side persistence alone is sufficient for the security
property (T8 proves that) but insufficient for availability.

**Status: implemented on the receiver, NOT yet on the sender.** Until the sender
lease exists, a v0B origin that loses power cannot resume talking to relays that
persisted its counter. This is written here rather than quietly omitted.

## What is still NOT tested

No LoRa / over-the-air radio (SX1262 remains mock-tested only, never on
silicon) — this whole chain is a **wire**. No sender-side counter lease (above).
No energy budget, no secure element, no flight. Flash endurance of the counter
sector not characterised; the production write-coalescing policy (≈1 write per
256 messages) is specified but the test flushes on demand instead.
